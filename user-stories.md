###Technical Plan

How many pages should be included in the test?
There should be at least 2: one that gives the test and one that shows the results to the client.

How should the test be presented to the volunteers?
There could be a brief instruction screen with a start button that takes you to the main test. The choices should be presented as simply as possible and once a selection is made the test should take the volunteer directly to the next question.

Should there be a description of the product?
Probably just a name of the product would be necessary.
